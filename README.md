# Nomster

## About

Nomster is similar to sites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor. It is devoted to unique venues and spaces. Users can create, comment on, and rate places they have visited.

## Getting Started

### Accounts

A user account is required in order to post comments and ratings, add pictures, and create place pages. However, places and comments can be viewed without signing up. Simply click the `Sign Up` link to get started. 

There is also a sample user account that can be signed into. The username is `nom@example.com`, and the password matches the username exactly.

### Basic Use

* Click on `Nomster` in the navigation bar to return to the home page.

* The home page lists all of the place entries. Click on the name of a place to view its full page. Here, you can view and add photos, comments, and ratings.

* To create your own place page, simply click on the `(+) New Place` link and fill out the form.

* To view information about your account, click on the `My Profile` navigation link. This page will also list the places you have created and the comments you have posted.
